This is a toy version of backtest written by me in April, 2018.

The principle is quite simple, I divided the stocks into 5 quantiles according to the values of a factor.

To trade the stock, I simply long the 5th quantile, and short the 1th quantile.

Also I calculate and draw several indexes to evaluate the result of the back test, such as IC and IR.

It is interesting to read the code I wrote when I just started to learn python, e.g. I did not use any class.

Very cute codes, just for memories.
